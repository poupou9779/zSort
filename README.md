# zSort

zSort is a repository containing several sorting algorithms.
The main function tests the different algorithms and computes the time needed by algo.

Currently, the used algorithms are :
* O(n²) :
	* insertion
	* selection
	* bubble
* O(n*log[n]) :
	* NONE	


TODO :
* Add sorting algorithms with different complexities (as fast and useful as possible)
